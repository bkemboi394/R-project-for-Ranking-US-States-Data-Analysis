```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown
```{r load tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)


```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load hospitals data}
th2011 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2011.csv")
th2012 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2012.csv")
th2013 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2013.csv")
th2014 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2014.csv")
th2015 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2015.csv")
th2016 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2016.csv")
th2017 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2017.csv")
th2018 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2018.csv")
th2019 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2019.csv")
th2020 <- read_csv("totalhospitals2020.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
