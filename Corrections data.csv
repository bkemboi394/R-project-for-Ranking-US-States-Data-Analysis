Expanded county jail contracting, additional capacity at an existing facility and the opening of two new facilities made this possible.

"660/ [2006] At the end of CY 2006 there were an additional 646 offenders in the custody and 722 offenders in the jurisdictions populations compared to the end of CY 2005.
